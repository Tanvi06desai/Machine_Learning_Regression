üèôÔ∏è PREDICTING THE APARTMENT RENT USING MACHINE LEARNING
Prepared by: Tanvi Desai

Business Problem / Discovery Phase
This project aims to predict apartment rental prices based on various property features such as location, size, number of rooms, and amenities. The dataset captures detailed information about rental listings, making it ideal for regression-based Machine Learning modeling.
Objective
To build a predictive model that accurately estimates the rental price (target variable) for apartments listed across different U.S. cities, based on their attributes and listing details.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning regression techniques can effectively predict apartment rental prices using property-level data.
Key takeaways:
Data preprocessing (imputation, outlier handling, encoding) critically affects model accuracy.
Ensemble models like Random Forest provide reliable, high-performing results for heterogeneous datasets.
The final model achieved an R¬≤ of 0.633, suggesting it explains ~63% of the price variance.
This workflow can be extended for price optimization, market segmentation, and real estate valuation use cases.
